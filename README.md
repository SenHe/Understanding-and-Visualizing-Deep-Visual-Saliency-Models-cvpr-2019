# Understanding-and-Visualizing-Deep-Visual-Saliency-Models-cvpr-2019
## Introduction
This is the demo of code, model and methods used in the paper.
There are some differences between the model used in the paper and this repository, the model used in the model is implemented in Tensorflow and the model in this repository is implemented in Pytorch(0.4.1).
## The Model Architecture:

The model is trained on Salicon database.
## Synthetic data and annotation
### Data annotation
All the data annotation is done by myself using [labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme)
